# Math Game ðŸŽ®

A simple Android app made using Java and Android Studio.  
It shows random addition questions with multiple-choice answers, keeps score, runs on a 30-second timer, and lets you restart the game.  
I found this project online and then made some changes in the code and UI as part of my learning. Credit goes to the original creator for the base project.
