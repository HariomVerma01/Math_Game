A simple and engaging Android app built using Java and Android Studio that helps users practice basic addition skills. The app generates random addition questions with four multiple-choice options and tracks the user's score within a 30-second countdown timer. The interface is clean and responsive, offering options to restart the quiz and improve performance. This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Android development. Future updates aim to include more operations, localization, and performance tracking. Contributions are welcome!
